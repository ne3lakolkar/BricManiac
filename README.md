# BricManiac

BricManiac is a single player online arcade game inspired from a retro video game - [dx Ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DX-Ball).

The inspiration for rebuilding the game was it's simplicity, just a single paddle controlling everything.

Happy playing !


## How to play 
As simple as it seems, you need to break the bricks present in the frame without dropping the ball out of the paddle's reach.                
That's it, only one chance to do it. 

To keep up with your score, a scoreboard is added to the right corner of the screen.

Hope you enjoy ;)


## Controls
- Hover your mouse in the horizontal axis anywhere in the game frame to move your paddle.

- Try not to make the ball fall down.
